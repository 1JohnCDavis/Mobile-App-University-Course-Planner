# Mobile-App-University-Course-Planner
A mobile app created with Xamarin forms that aids students in planning their terms, courses, and assessments.  The application is for both Android and IOS devices.  A user can add a term consisting of a title, start date, and end date.  Then they can add as many courses as necessary associated with that term.  A course consists of a title, start/end dates, status indicating whether the course is in progress or not, instructor's name/phone/email address, miscellaneous notes, and whether or not notifications are enabled.  If enabled, push notifications send reminders to the user the day of a course starting as well as the day it is ending.  There is also an option to share course notes via SMS, email, etc.  Assessments associated with each course can be added with notification functionality for their due dates.  Terms are prevented from being deleted until all courses are disassociated with them.  The same goes for courses if they still have assessments associated with them.  SQLite is used to store data locally to the users device.
